# PerformanceAnalysis

What are the questions we always ask when we analyze the performance of a strategy?
- What's the average daily pnl
- What's the daily return in bps
- What's the maximum daily pnl, or the distribution of daily pnl
- What's the maximum drawdown
- What's the sharpe ratio
- What's the daily delta (so analyzing hedge cost and difficuity)
- What's the absolute daily delta
- What's the daily number of trades
- Split data by symbols and see what's the maximum pnl of symbols
    - The reason of doing this is to test whether the pnl highly depends one of the symbol
    - Remove one of the symbol and see whether this result is still good
- QQPlot or F-test to see whether the return is normal distribution or not
- Prove of performance is better than random walk (average > 0)
- Smoothness of params grid search result

# Basic required to test the program

    - date
    - symbol
- columns
    - Info, price; Info, probs; Info, volume
    - Pnl, pnl
